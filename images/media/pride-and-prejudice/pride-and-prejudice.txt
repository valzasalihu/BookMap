Set in early 19th-century England during the Napoleonic Wars, the Bennet family of Longbourn faces financial insecurity because their estate is entailed to Mr. Collins. Mrs. Bennet is desperate to marry off her five daughters. Hope arrives with Mr. Bingley, a wealthy bachelor who rents nearby Netherfield and takes an immediate liking to Jane. His friend, Mr. Darcy, is proud and initially disliked—especially by Elizabeth, whom he refuses to dance with.

Elizabeth meets the charming officer Wickham, who claims Darcy wronged him, strengthening her prejudice. Meanwhile, Mr. Collins proposes to Elizabeth but is rejected; he then marries her friend Charlotte instead. Influenced by Darcy and his sisters, Bingley abruptly leaves for London, breaking Jane’s heart.

During a visit to Charlotte in Kent, Darcy unexpectedly proposes to Elizabeth. She angrily refuses, accusing him of separating Jane and Bingley and mistreating Wickham. Darcy later writes her a letter explaining the truth: Wickham squandered money given by Darcy’s father and attempted to elope with Darcy’s young sister. He also explains that he believed Jane did not love Bingley and was concerned about the Bennet family’s behaviour. Elizabeth realises she has misjudged him.

While travelling with the Gardiners, Elizabeth visits Darcy’s estate, Pemberley, and sees a kinder side of him. She begins to regret her earlier refusal. News then arrives that Lydia has run off with Wickham, threatening the family’s reputation. Darcy secretly finds the couple in London, pays Wickham’s debts, and arranges their marriage.

Returning to Hertfordshire, Darcy and Bingley come back to Netherfield. Bingley proposes to Jane. Lady Catherine de Bourgh then tries to force Elizabeth to promise she will never marry Darcy, but Elizabeth refuses. Encouraged by this, Darcy proposes again, and Elizabeth accepts. After gaining Mr. Bennet’s blessing, they become engaged, as do Jane and Bingley, restoring peace and honour to the family.
