George Orwell’s 1984 portrays a terrifying future in which a totalitarian government controls every aspect of life. The story takes place in Oceania, a superstate ruled by the Party and its mysterious leader, Big Brother. Citizens live under constant surveillance through telescreens, hidden microphones, and the Thought Police, who punish even the slightest sign of rebellion or independent thinking.

The protagonist, Winston Smith, works at the Ministry of Truth, where his job is to falsify historical records so that the Party always appears correct. Aware of the lies he helps create, Winston secretly despises the regime and begins writing his private thoughts in a diary, knowing it is a deadly act of resistance.

Winston forms a forbidden romantic relationship with Julia, a young woman who also rejects the Party’s control. For a brief period, they believe they have found freedom in a rented room above an antique shop. However, they are betrayed, arrested, and taken to the Ministry of Love. There, Winston is tortured by O’Brien, an Inner Party member, until he betrays Julia and fully submits to Party ideology.

Broken physically and psychologically, Winston ultimately accepts the Party’s version of reality and learns to love Big Brother.
